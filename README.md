# 🏍️ Motorcycle Workshop (Full-Stack Project)

This project is a full-stack web application where I imagine owning my own motorcycle workshop.  
I’ve spent years riding and working with different workshops that don’t have much of an online presence, so I decided to build one myself as a learning project.

Everything runs locally for development so I don’t need to spend money on hosting.  
Feel free to clone, pull, and play around with it!

## 🚀 Tech Stack

**Backend: ASP.NET**  
I’ve worked with .NET frameworks like MAUI in school and really enjoyed them, so I chose ASP.NET for the backend.

**Frontend: React (TypeScript)**  
This is my first step into modern frontend development. Since React is widely used in industry, I decided to learn it through this project.

**Database: MariaDB**  
Similar to MySQL but open source. I’m comfortable with MariaDB from school projects and enjoyed working with it.  
On the server side, you’ll find a `.sql` file with all the creation scripts.

## 🎯 Goals

- Learn React by building a real-world style app.  
- Practice full-stack development with ASP.NET, React, and MariaDB.  
- Build something fun and personal related to motorcycles.
